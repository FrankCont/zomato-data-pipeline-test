They were just average and the cake was dry Top of it slow service and we had asked for items we ordered on a sparsely occupied weekday afternoon.

I may not visit again., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Went here for lunch and found this place quite peaceful to sit with friends. Pizza which we ordered was great.

Overall an average pizza experience., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Food  910nService  810nAmbience  919nCost  810nnOne of the best place to have pizzas in bangalore. They have wide variety of pizzas and drinks to have. All freshly prepared in front of your eyes. The ambience is very good with soft music., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Good ambiance, and they have the cutest doggos  Thats probably the best part Lol, jk jk. The food was equally good. The pizza was very nice, drinks good too. The nachos could use a little work, rather replace the chips with another brand or something, they were very basic. Apart from that its been great , Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Coming here 4th time. Tastes better in each time. Love for their food is increasing each time. Ambiance is not that high class but ya taste is what really matters. Staff is well serving.",[],Dine-out,Banashankari,,

The chicken was cooked nicely and was so soft.., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Went here for lunch today and the place was almost packed. One good thing that I liked about here is that they have entrance through both sides. Seating can be a bit cramped and the service is fast coz of the small space. I ordered the mutton biryani and my friend ordered white rice and pepper chicken. The Biriyani was well cooked and there were good pieces of mutton in it. Cooked properly as well. The pepper chicken was also pretty spicy and tasted quite nice as well. The only reason why the rating is a bit low is coz of the space issue. Pricing is also kind of fair and does not damage your pocket so much , Rated 1.5, RATEDn  Best Location. It has entrance from two sides of road. I had Chicken Biryani here and it was ok.

Their sandwiches were good too but then they started going downhill which is evident from their current rating.nnThe service was always poor due to lack of manpower., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  As much pretty and breezy the cafe is, the food was that bad. I had ordered a chicken cheese keema omelette and a hot chocolate. In place of the keema, which ideally means minced chicken, there were large pieces of chicken just in between the omelette. There was barely any cheese and also, salt was concentrated in pockets. This indicates the lack of stirring while mixing ingredients before making the omelette. nAt the same time, there was no bread on the menu. Even if I wanted to order it separately, I couldnt. What is the point of having a breakfast place that doesnt serve breadnAlso, at 930 am in the morning, there were no milk based products. So caffe latte was unavailable. Only black teacoffee. I had no option but to opt for a hot chocolate.nGiven, the very nice ambiance of the place, heaps of improvements can be made in service and food quality., Rated 1.0, RATEDn  Worst Mumbai cutting chai I ever had.. there is no proper service..... the place is not clean and rates r really high.. no happiness in visiting this useless place, Rated 1.5, RATEDn  Bad service. Very unappealing place. Seems like an abandoned cafe is started again. Half the things you wish to order are unavailable..and the servers dont seem to understand what you say.. the cutlery is old and they serve the black coffee cold.., Rated 3.5, RATEDn  Place is nxt to parkview restaurant on mine forest road near MTR, I had ordered for doppio  espresso Americano wch was really good... And place wr smoking is allowed outside...., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  We are looking for a place with less crowd and silent where finally got this place in Zomato. It is Good place to meet  friends and closer one. coffee is nice and cost is reasonable., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Nice place. Great place to unwind after a tiring day. Went there alone thinking it will be boring, but the staff was so courteous. Good greenery and decor inside. Ordered potato wedges, Latte at first. Potato wedges were nicely cooked and crisp and latte was nice, better than CCD. It was soothing place and flipped a few pages of Jeffrey Archer which I adore nThe staff was very nice and did not disturb me though they inquired if I would like something else. After sometime I ordered garlic bread and Thai chicken sandwich. It was awesome. I think i will become regular visitor of this place , Rated 2.0, RATEDn  I agree, it is nice to hang out here but only in the outdoors patio. Inside is stuffy and odor from over the years cooking food inside is there to linger. I wont be able to sit inside, its too stuffy.nNow, for the coffee, its okay. Nothing to rave about but I will not slam it, its just coffee.nAs for service, it was just ok as well. I notice here in BLR, at least on most places I have been. Theyre quick to sit you, but lag following up with basic customer service common sense, such as asking if customer would like anything to drink while going through a menu. Small stuff like that. All in all its ok. Ill look around the neighborhood if there any other coffee shop that has the same patio that is good to hangout., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Nice place to hang out, mostly young crowd, smokers will love it, place needs to be little hygienic, food preparation is good, had nicely prepared spinach and corn sandwich, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  cuppa bistro, its a lounge, near to Sri jaydeva hospital. a good place. service is good,food or bites are amazing, best you can try for espresso. the quick bites l, Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Im a Cafe person and I had been eyeing Cuppa for the longest time.

Price is reasonable with reasonable quality. Sandwiches are average and the fries are good. I have tasted Assam tea, masala tea and cappuccino. They are very average. You can visit this place if you wanna read a book while sipping some tea and spend some time there., Rated 3.5, RATEDn  Its again nice place to spend some coffee time or to work comfortably. Set up is very nice. You can be seated inside or Outside set up is very nicebut a bit noisy.

Definitely a great place to have some good conversations over coffee., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Starbucks is always a great coffee experience for me. The outlet at Jayanagar is the only one in the city that serves the new Nitro Cold Brew, and I was in for that as soon as it was released.nnThe ambiance is quintessential Starbucks, and essentially the same as any other in the country. The service, as usual, is blazing fast. The best part of Sbux is that you can actually customise your coffee from the scratch, milk, to shots of espresso, to flavours etc which is great.nnThe nitro cold brew that I ordered was amazing. It was smoother than the usual hot brews, or the frappuccino they serve. The flavour was rich and the taste was pleasingly bitter. Their blueberry delight is one of my favourite desserts ever, and a personal recommendation. nnStep in for one of the premium coffee experiences and Sbux wont fail you, From their variety to the brew they prepare, its all great",[],Desserts,Basavanagudi,,

However after sometime it feels great with the music and the people around. The lights are vibrant and the decor catches your attention. I went for Dinner with my family. We were 5 of us. The mocktails were good. We ordered Kung pao chicken, Murgh Dum Biriyani, Tawa Tardka, Chicken hariyali, Peas pulav. The food quantity was good and tasty as well. The staffs were very  cordial and welcoming. Our hunger was satisfied and it took just above 2k for the bill for it. Surely a place to visit if in Sarjapur area. Btw Outside cakes, foods are strictly not allowed here., Rated 2.0, RATEDn  Visited this place for a office team lunch as this is on the main road and looks appealing from outside. Food is good, but my reason for a 2 star is their customer service skills which needs to be improved a lot. Inspite of making a table reservation, we were asked to adjust on a smaller table and the manager was hell bent on making us adjust., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Pretty neat place to hang out with buddies and team parties. Its just a stone throw from Wipro Sarjapur campus. Wonderful ambience. They have a good spread for lunch buffet and a delectable variety of desserts. I tried their a la carte. The service was very friendly and helpful in choosing the dishes. Food didnt take too long. Lasooni kebab was awesome. The Mutton biryani was also sumptuous. The rest of the meal too did not disappoint and were great. All who came along just loved the food and atmosphere. Definitely a great place., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  We tried veg and nonveg dishes. We really liked the taste of the food. Quantity is more than we expected. Micro brewery is awesome here. Tried Stout and IPA beer which taste very good.

The experience was not up to the mark, as I have visited Samaroh with my parents, keeping in mind that the theme is pure vegetarian with royal food.nnVerdict I would recommend, the reception of the guests should be warm as per Rajasthani culture, as the guest would definitely like to enjoy the traditional settings by coming to such restaurants., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  A perfect place for large family gettogethers, esp if the majority of them are vegetarians or vegpreferring.. the folks here have a diverse array of vegetarian dishes which work well for the most part.. their wide selection of starters is especially noteworthy.. also noteworthy is their exceptional attention to detail, their obsession with getting the authenticity right..The menu items are a bit on the pricier side though .., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Why should you go this placen For some yummy North Indian Veg foodn You are looking for a buffet placen You prefer quality over quantityn You want to eat good food and not be bombarded with useless items just for the name sake which you would not enjoy at all, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  We went to this place as a group of 18 members on a Sunday afternoon. Overall, the place is average from ambience point of view. The first thing which I liked was the cutlery which were used to serve various items, each cutlery is so cute and well thought out before procuring. Each item came one after another on table with completely different cutlery. Coming to food, I felt the food was average too, nothing to complaint or praise either. However, the service boys were quite prompt and cheerful while serving. One of the roti serving guy, even forced us to eat extra chapatis. Overall, good experience as we went in big group, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  There are more than one reason to visit this restaurant located in the Bay..nFirst reason is of course food  food is delicious and sumptuous.. The quantity is just right..nStarters are good.. Main course is hot and tasty. Deserts are just yummy..nSecond reason is ambience and service.. Very good indeed..nThird and probably most important is cutlery.. It is just amazing.. It feels great to eat and drink with the brass..nI highly recommend this restaurant.., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Samaroh in RMZ bay is a visit to traditional Indian food. The aura of the place is charming and the food will remind you of the flavors of IndianTheir menu keeps changing daily and they offer one big thali at 699 and smaller thali combos around 300.nI wasnt hungry so I tried the smaller combo of paneer roti dal sabzi with lassi. The taste was good although my only complaint would be the quantity of the phulkas. They served only 3 in the plate and I dont think it will be enough for anyone. They should increase the quantity for the price that they charge.nService is good and the restaurants menu prices includes service charge as well.",[],Delivery,Bellandur,,

They had many tempting flavors. The place has availability of both indoor and outdoor seating. You can just go to the counter, order and then enjoy. The price of each variety is same. It depends only on quantity whether u go for a smaller or larger scoop. Smaller scoop costed me 65 bucks for 1 scoop. I had Funky Ferrero and Scrumptious Sitafal. Both tasted good but not amazing. Overall it was a good experience., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  I ordered a cookie and cream ice cream box. It was the most amazing cookie and cream ice cream I have ever had.

The ice creams here are very average. This rating is not for this particular outlet but Apsara in general. Have tried many things from the menu but nothing made us go wow.nPabrais is far ahead of them overall.. even naturals ice cream is decent.., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  I have been here last week couple of times with cousins and friends. Absolutely loved their ice cream flavours and varieties. The staff will explain you patiently their offerings and also let you taste their offerings without being grumpy. We had pineapple and sitafal in their natural flavours and panipuri and tamarind in their specials which were bang on. Loved the chilly guava as well. Pricing is also good here. Will definitely keep coming to try other flavours.nThey deliver online via swiggy only currently. Expecting them to partner with zomato and uber eats shortly , Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Mumbais popular ice cream chain  Apsara Ice Cream has opened outlets all over the city and serve the same delicious flavors they are well known for.nnTheir USP is their natural fruit flavored ice creams, so no wonder that I preferred to try their signature Guava ice cream. This was full of flavour and felt like eating a frozen Guava Next, I tried the Sitaphal ice cream and this did not disappoint eithernnWill definitely go back to try their other flavours soon, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  You cant eat just one  This line is soooo true in their case...nA range of new and exceptionally good flavours...nI cant decide my favourite coz I loved all the flavours that I tried here...nBut dont miss out on their Guava and Paani Puri flavour...

Tried guava with red chilli.. it tastes so natural.. seemed like eating real guava with the chilli powder on it.. A must recommended dessert place for all... Would try other flavours like pan, mango, lichi, sitafal.. its irresistible , Rated 5.0, RATEDn  I tried the Tamarind, Blueberry cheesecake, Pani puri and the Belgian Chocolate ice cream at this cute looking place All the flavours were fantastic. Must try tamarind with the powder which makes it really taste like the jet airways toffee. The portion size is very good and I enjoyed the unique flavours. What I also liked is that the owners were behind the counter to serve. They were giving very good suggestions and it was perfect Would definitely recommend it., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  I think any place is differentiated first by quality of food and second by the service Apsara Bellandur sets its expectations high on both these metrics. The ice creams are brilliant, they have all kinds of flavours and variants. From beautiful fruity flavours like apricot and orange, to classics like Belgian chocolate and of course their stellar experimental sorbets that they proudly serve  pani puri sorbet and guava ice cream. They add a little masala to them both, adding the extra blitz to the taste. Plus, itx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92s 100 vegetarian.

When we went there for lunch the AC was not working and when we complained, the reception lady just said we are having issues and you can write it in feedback which we were never given at the end. So we basically ate our food in the hot atmosphere with no choices of a cold dessert at end. The food menu is not very robust here and is very selective with poor choice of placement. The food was getting over fairly quickly here with not so many guests inside. The dessert section was fairly empty too with not so fresh looking rasgullas, the barely there cut fruits and super hot kheer and halwa.

Ordered online from Paratha Box , they first accepted the order. After 15 mins I get an update that they have cancelled the order, so I called them and they said that your place is far  5 km  and we cant deliver there. When asked that why did you accept the order if you cant deliver they said that I didnt see the address and so cant deliver now I am rejecting the order. This is very unprofessional and bad behaviour. Once they have accepted they should have delivered the order as its their mistake for accepting the order first and then cancelling after 15 mins my place was about 6 kms from their place and they should have delivered as it was their mistake of accepting the order. They have no respect for customers time or service.

So I ordered my lunch from Eat fit, Chefs special Veg Thali.The delivery was quick and the packaging was superb. Every Item was individually packed and well labelled. It was a complete meal where all the nutritional requirement was well considered, from high fibre gluten free rotis to probiotic yogurt, even you can have the dessert without any guilt as they offer protein bar as desserts. The meal consisted of roti, paneer gravy, no cream dal makhani, salad, pickle, protein bar, yogurt and superfood of the day. The best part was the food was healthy yet tasty. They havent compromised on taste aspect in the name of healthy food., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  When its fancy on the outside but when you open the same you are disappointedpics enclosed. Curry was all over the box. I didnt really enjoy the food. Yes its supposed to be healthy but it had to taste reasonably good as well. Every item had a sweet tinge to it.

Sadly the taste could not match the expectations raised while looking at the box. Nothing great to write about about the paratha.nnTwo paratha for about INR 150 is also not value for money.nnnEdit 120102018 Ordered Chicken Chettinad and Coin Parathas MealnnHot and Tasty meal.

They had many tempting flavors. The place has availability of both indoor and outdoor seating. You can just go to the counter, order and then enjoy. The price of each variety is same. It depends only on quantity whether u go for a smaller or larger scoop. Smaller scoop costed me 65 bucks for 1 scoop. I had Funky Ferrero and Scrumptious Sitafal. Both tasted good but not amazing. Overall it was a good experience., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  I ordered a cookie and cream ice cream box. It was the most amazing cookie and cream ice cream I have ever had. My friend and I finished the box almost immediately. Let the ice cream melt a lil and then it tastes exactly like a Oreo thickshake It was just amazing , Rated 2.0, RATEDn  Overrated. The ice creams here are very average. This rating is not for this particular outlet but Apsara in general. Have tried many things from the menu but nothing made us go wow.nPabrais is far ahead of them overall.. even naturals ice cream is decent.., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  I have been here last week couple of times with cousins and friends. Absolutely loved their ice cream flavours and varieties. The staff will explain you patiently their offerings and also let you taste their offerings without being grumpy. We had pineapple and sitafal in their natural flavours and panipuri and tamarind in their specials which were bang on. Loved the chilly guava as well. Pricing is also good here. Will definitely keep coming to try other flavours.nThey deliver online via swiggy only currently. Expecting them to partner with zomato and uber eats shortly , Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Mumbais popular ice cream chain  Apsara Ice Cream has opened outlets all over the city and serve the same delicious flavors they are well known for.nnTheir USP is their natural fruit flavored ice creams, so no wonder that I preferred to try their signature Guava ice cream. This was full of flavour and felt like eating a frozen Guava Next, I tried the Sitaphal ice cream and this did not disappoint eithernnWill definitely go back to try their other flavours soon, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  You cant eat just one  This line is soooo true in their case...nA range of new and exceptionally good flavours...nI cant decide my favourite coz I loved all the flavours that I tried here...nBut dont miss out on their Guava and Paani Puri flavour...

Tried guava with red chilli.. it tastes so natural.. seemed like eating real guava with the chilli powder on it.. A must recommended dessert place for all... Would try other flavours like pan, mango, lichi, sitafal.. its irresistible , Rated 5.0, RATEDn  I tried the Tamarind, Blueberry cheesecake, Pani puri and the Belgian Chocolate ice cream at this cute looking place All the flavours were fantastic. Must try tamarind with the powder which makes it really taste like the jet airways toffee. The portion size is very good and I enjoyed the unique flavours. What I also liked is that the owners were behind the counter to serve. They were giving very good suggestions and it was perfect Would definitely recommend it., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  I think any place is differentiated first by quality of food and second by the service Apsara Bellandur sets its expectations high on both these metrics. The ice creams are brilliant, they have all kinds of flavours and variants. From beautiful fruity flavours like apricot and orange, to classics like Belgian chocolate and of course their stellar experimental sorbets that they proudly serve  pani puri sorbet and guava ice cream. They add a little masala to them both, adding the extra blitz to the taste. Plus, itx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92s 100 vegetarian.

The taste was okay. Foods were served at right temperature and presentation was okay., Rated 3.5, RATEDn  Ok is what is would rate and not coz they did anything wrong but just coz the taste pallets are so very used to Dominos , Pizza Hut and Papa Jones. I would rate it a 5 just coz its different but does that counter the very familiar taste pallets  NO. You dont expect a whole chunk of chicken on your pizza , neither a spicy sauce base. The dough though is alright and ok to order once you get used to it . As a marketing strategy though would recommend to price it a bit lower to compete with the market and capture market penetration...and then place it as a gourmet product, Rated 3.0, RATEDn  I have complaint on this guys. I am a regular visitor for their sandwiches as itis fresh and tasty. But the guys in the outlet is absolute idiots.

I come here for the experience for sure.nnThe food is fabulous and also the ambiance.nnCannot not mention the service as well, very well trained staff who are polite too.nnThali is definitely something I would opt for if I am coming here..nnYou will never be disappointed here., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  I am not sure why it was given 4.1 star. We went for a lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. The moment we entered this place it was smelling weird. We asked the staff and they just sprayed another pungent room freshner. After getting settled down we ordered for soup both veg and nonveg. It was not warm and felt like water only. The starters like bhendi kurkure, and non veg platter was good though. But again the main course was unsatisfactory. The garlic naan was good but the chicken curry had lots of tomatoes. The mutton curry was good. Last we had the desserts which was served after a huge gap., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  The live music was so good It was all old calming hindi songs, the food was good but not very spicy even after requesting. The service and ambience 55. A great place for families and people to go and enjoy the comfort homely food, along with the music., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Punjabi Times is a cozy rooftop restaurant in bellandur.nThis places ambience impresses me the mostnYou can find most of the authentic punjabi cuisine items in the menu and they taste all good.nI had tried paneer tikka masala and cheesy chilli naan which was really good., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Excellent ambience, loved the life singer. Good service. Should try their cocktails .definitely worth a visit .dont forget to try their sarso ka saag, murg bhatinda and cheesy chilli naan., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Punjabi times is pretty easy to locate.nThe interiors of the restaurant is pretty neat with a few installations here and there. The staff is friendly and the service is great.nThe food is priced a little on the higher side, but the quantity justifies it. And the taste is fairly good.nThe only draw back I felt was that the place was really mind numbingly loud. They had karaoke where people came in and sang songs which was actually irritating., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Located in the hush hush area, its a nice place to have punjabi cuisine as far as this city goes Also provides live music and the staff is also really helpful, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  I had been here for a Team lunch. We were really skeptical about this place initially but our speculations changed after a great lunch at this place.nnBuffet  45nAmbiance  4.5nService  3.55nnMy review is purely based on the BuffetnnThis place gives good quality food for both Veg and NonVegetarian Folks. If you are on a fast and cannot eat NonVeg you will definitely not regret being a Veggie for the day as they have a wide variety of Veg dishes too.nnThere is a Chat counter, Butter Milk counter, Dessert Counter, Live Parota Counter and a Complimentary Beverage Alcohol or Mocktail.nnMakke di Roti, Sarson da Saag, Aloo Parota, Fish Fry, Dhai Puri, Crispy Baby Corn etc are some dishes I liked the most. nnPlace worth visiting more than once., Rated 2.0, RATEDn  My God this place had a pathetic service, the food takes forever to come out of the kitchen, the staff disappears after taking the order. The only thing that came fast to my table was the bill.Coming to the food, the small Tandoori platter had 4 different types of kebab, the chicken kebabs in it were very chewy, fish kebab was dry like Thar desert and had no taste whatsoever. Mutton livery fry was good well seasoned and tender. firangi sabzi was also well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Lassi and Thandai were good. However I was told the lassi will be served in a matka, but it came in a glass. The desert came to my table 25 minutes after ordering. The Rabri was slightly sour, moong dal halwah on the other hand was good, but not worth it, specially after a wait of 25 minutes., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Ambience  The place has a true punjabi village feel to it. As soon as you enter, there is a whiff of punjabi masalas and your eyes will fall on the waiting space that has a swing kind of seating. The walls have huge dhols tugging out, there are colourful bangles used for decoration and a map of punjab made of copper looking bowls.nnLocation  on the service road of ORR. It is a crowded road but they do have parking so not a lot to complain.nnFood  GreatnWe had MURG TIKKA LABABDAAR and it was quite good.nnMissi roti  multigrain roti were good and a relief from the usual naan  tandoori rotisnnVery tasty chaach as a side drink.nnService  good  promptnnPrice  pretty reasonable., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Food quality is excellent and service also.Reasonable and affordable.Anything I have ordered from the menu in all my 4 visits, the food has been extremely tastyI have always ended up licking my finger.Good ambiance too.

The only thing that came fast to my table was the bill.Coming to the food, the small Tandoori platter had 4 different types of kebab, the chicken kebabs in it were very chewy, fish kebab was dry like Thar desert and had no taste whatsoever. Mutton livery fry was good well seasoned and tender. firangi sabzi was also well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Lassi and Thandai were good. However I was told the lassi will be served in a matka, but it came in a glass. The desert came to my table 25 minutes after ordering. The Rabri was slightly sour, moong dal halwah on the other hand was good, but not worth it, specially after a wait of 25 minutes., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Ambience  The place has a true punjabi village feel to it. As soon as you enter, there is a whiff of punjabi masalas and your eyes will fall on the waiting space that has a swing kind of seating.

Overall, the place is average from ambience point of view. The first thing which I liked was the cutlery which were used to serve various items, each cutlery is so cute and well thought out before procuring. Each item came one after another on table with completely different cutlery. Coming to food, I felt the food was average too, nothing to complaint or praise either. However, the service boys were quite prompt and cheerful while serving. One of the roti serving guy, even forced us to eat extra chapatis.

The quantity is just right..nStarters are good.. Main course is hot and tasty. Deserts are just yummy..nSecond reason is ambience and service.. Very good indeed..nThird and probably most important is cutlery.. It is just amazing.. It feels great to eat and drink with the brass..nI highly recommend this restaurant.., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Samaroh in RMZ bay is a visit to traditional Indian food. The aura of the place is charming and the food will remind you of the flavors of IndianTheir menu keeps changing daily and they offer one big thali at 699 and smaller thali combos around 300.nI wasnt hungry so I tried the smaller combo of paneer roti dal sabzi with lassi. The taste was good although my only complaint would be the quantity of the phulkas. They served only 3 in the plate and I dont think it will be enough for anyone.

The staff was really helpful in arranging especially Elizabeth who helped us fix the menu and plan it out.nWe had two sets of people one who were driving and the others who werent.

However, the inhouse brews are wonderful, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  A posh BBQ buffet restaurant in UB City, with a decent pricing. The food taste was good but the variety was lacking. Only negetive point i found in the menu was the Biryani. They made the Biryani out of boiled rice which gave a different taste and flavor which was no were close to actual biryani.

It was quite difficult to locate this place. But we finally made it, we had Chicken Wings, Burger In house open burger veg and Lots of fun lamb Burger and Mocktails Green Apple Mojito and Blue Heaven. If we look as service, it was pretty decent apart from the serving time at least 45 mins mentioned in menu, which I thought is quite more compare to other cafes and restaurants. And if we look at ambience of this place, as you see this place is a rooftop cafe, so it has amazing view of the city.nnOverall it was good experience. Thank you, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Located on one of the busiest roads in bangalore. Very easy to spot it.nnAmbience is very soothing. Calm and peaceful with some good collection of songs.nnComing to the food, no comments. Its yummm, Rated 3.0, RATEDn  The look and feel of this place is well designed. The best part is its outdoor seating, decorated with flowers and white sheets, where you can sit and watch the entire stretch of MG road. Have visited this place twice with my colleagues, and liked it both the times. The food was decent, and the colorful drinks were refreshing., Rated 2.0, RATEDn  We did dirty mistake of going there on a weekend. Staff was rude. Food was delayed. The quantity sucked. Wouldnx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92t recommend to anyone.SPECIALLY ON A HOLIDAY, Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Loved the cheese garlic bread at Azzure. Easily one of the best in the city. Cheesy fries could be presented a bit better but was good as well. When it came to the main course my friend order a veg burger and seemed to like it. But when I ordered the baked fish there was a piece of hair on it. When I sent it back all they did was take out the hair and give me the same dish back in 2 minutes. When I asked how they made another one so fast the waiter said he just took it out and sent it back. Not sure how hygiene is rated on this restaurant. But until I asked for another fresh plate to be cooked they didnt do it from their side., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Food 45nService 35nAmbience 45nnWent with my colleagues some time back on September, Apologies for updating review after so much time. It was quite difficult to locate this place. But we finally made it, we had Chicken Wings, Burger In house open burger veg and Lots of fun lamb Burger and Mocktails Green Apple Mojito and Blue Heaven. If we look as service, it was pretty decent apart from the serving time at least 45 mins mentioned in menu, which I thought is quite more compare to other cafes and restaurants. And if we look at ambience of this place, as you see this place is a rooftop cafe, so it has amazing view of the city.nnOverall it was good experience.

Both were not good. Rest of the items in main course were just Ok. In deserts they had chocolate brownie, black jamun, black forest pastry. I tried black jamun and it was hopeless to say the least. Black forest was just about ok. Ice cream was also served and it was ok.nService Average., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Have passed by this place so many times final got to visit yesterday for lunch. The food was good. Mutton sizzlers were great and they were good enough to break the bone to get at the marrow. Chicken sizzler was equally good. The portions were quite substantial. The only defect was the service was shoddy on a day when it was not even quarter full., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Located on Church Street, a hungry stomach and a craving for steak made us decide to visit this place. Nice touch on those tricolor cakes to celebrate independence day by the way. The ambience is good by being open air, however, I think it would be better if they keep smoking and non smoking zones separate.

Little difficult to locate this place while u r on the move... Not suitable for large groups and ladies., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Simple menu, pocket friendly and yummy muttonnnActually got to know about this place on some travel channel which showcased how the place is famous for the kusthi and food And recently read about it in the Metro plus.nLocated on a bylane so youll have to park elsewhere and walk a little. And we did a take away on a Friday afternoon at 230. Small and congested seating area.And since the cooking happens inside, its hot and sweaty which makes it ideal for takeaway.Also there were no women there when I went.nnI felt that the much raved about biryani was average the rice couldve been cooked better. But the meat was so soft and melted.nWe ordered the seer fish fry which was marinated well and deep fried.nI could see that the mutton chops were almost on every table, so we ordered that too. This was so goodnAnd the mutton kheema balls gravy was simply superbnIf you are a meat lover, this place is a must try in Bangalore All this for just 480 And we were serviced fast too., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Itx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92ll be totally worth to visit this place on a Friday.

Taste is normal , less in spice,mild masala, what you pay is very less n you pay for the authenticity. Its old Desi garadi or akhada turned hotel. Surprisingly you will see a small well inside which is alive. Worth trying, typical Muslim ambience. Very cheap. Its ryt in front of govt. V.K.O school and college., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  This place is probably the oldest bengaluru hotel which has been up from 1939 and serves delicious authentic muslim style foods. They serve this amazing muslim style mutton biryani only on fridays at 1pm and it might probably get over by 2 30pm. Everything, except the mutton biryani will be available in all days and the ones to try would be  the seer fish fry, mutton cutlet, mutton chops, kheema ball and kushka. the prices are very cheap for non veg. cost for two comes up to Rs 300 . Do try this legendary non veg hotel of namma bengauru and I am sure you wont be disappointed.",[],Dine-out,Brigade Road,,

The ambience... The seats... The crowd... You will make sure this falls under your favorite to be destination list if you dwell in the Silicon City, Rated 1.0, RATEDn  I think from the moment we set foot in this place nothing went right.nWe were given a seat at the very end on top floor which not only felt isolated, but was not well kept or maintained either. It was just a set of extra table and chairs thatx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92s it..nThe service is pretty slow and the staff looks uninterested add to it the fact that the manager or I donx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92t know who came to our seat asking if we have booked the place, like if by chance we had not booked it he would have thrown us out..nThe food is plain sad there is nothing interesting and no effort has gone into either curating the menu or the taste.nDrinks were sad, and again served with minimal effort.nThe only good thing about this place was the music which by the way we couldnx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92t hear properly because of our sitting arrangement...the least they could have done is install a mini speaker.nNot visiting again and not recommending to anyone either., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Thatx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92s a pretty good location, very close to MG Road metro and the rooftop scenes are good. Service was okay and food is also okay. Itx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92s better to go with reservations on weekend and prefer sitting over the top., Rated 2.0, RATEDn  We went and ordered drinks. Most of their Skydeck special cocktails on menu were unavailable. Even Bira beer wasnt available. They messed up with the basic Mojito as well. First brought Virgin Mojito. When I reminded I had asked for the proper Mojito, they just added a little vodka on top. We had to keep reminding the orders made.nnThe food taste however was good. We had ordered only veg items but they were quiet good., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Giving 4  because of its location. Its nice seating outside terrace. Makes it a pleasant place with cool breeze.

Do plan to visit again, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Whatta cozy and lovely place man Really loved it Poolside seating is treat to your eyes Great ambience Pricing is little higher side but worth it, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  A descent dining experience poolside as well as indoors. The food is good and tasty. We ordered a Venezuelan Pizza and a Vegetarian burger for lunch, both were average and nothing much talking about. At dinner we ordered America Choupsey and Veg Hakka Noodles and you could feel the difference as we had to order fast food as lunch hours were over. The Chinese tasted really good. My only suggestion would be to check the timings for lunch and dinner before arriving., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  The place looks worth a bomb. Ordered a lasagna and nachos. Both the dishes tasted decent, nothing extraordinary. The staff is not that attentive and the service is slow. Only recommended for the ambience it has. Pricing is on the higher side, but they have Zomato gold which helps, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  This is the best restaurant I have visited in a long time. The ambiance is just amazing the food is equally good and if you go for lunch over there you would just love the environment near the pool area. The entry to it is a little difficult as it is located in between villas but otherwise it is an awesome experience. If you go here after lunch hours you would get a special evening menu which has quite interesting things to eat and with zomato gold it even makes it better., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  We visited this place a few days back , the quality of Indian food is very good. Chinese food is not up to the mark here. Would recommend only to have indian good here, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Definitely one of the nicest experiences in Bengaluru.
