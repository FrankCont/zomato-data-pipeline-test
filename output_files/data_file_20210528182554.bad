But the only hassle is that their pricing is pretty hiked and I never feel like ordering from them until and unless Ix83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92m getting a good deal. Other than the last concern, this is one place Ix83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92ll never hesitate to order from., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Great place to have healthy and wholesome meals. Best option for fitness freaks who keeps tracks of their macros. Menu keeps changing daily with few repeatations.

It is good for gym person.nI also tried fruit oat meal which is also quiet good but quantity is less if compared with price.nI have also tried Veg chef thali and I will recommend everyone to try this if they want to eat hygienic north Indian food. Paneer, dal makni and roti everything is delicious.nnI recently tried Rajma Chawal with Jeera rice, it is totally Punjabi style and too delicious,however quantity is less but overall very good. I have provided the screenshot below., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Eat fit.. Health is wealth.. Healthy breakfast keeps you fit ,makes your morning good, as its name is.

Its a saviour.nHad premium roti thali which had dal, butter panner, roti, stuffed capsicum, curd, rice and chutney. It was really tasty and yummy with less oil and spices. Especially Chutney was delicious.nService is fast and the staff behavior is good., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  You get the best poha in HSR layout at this place. Its my all time order. They give some namkeen as well packed separately. Poha is very simple to make, but can be spoiled easily. Have tried poha from several outlets in HSR, but none good. Either it will be too dry or with no taste and just overloaded with onions. Poha here is cooked properly  soft, but not soggy.nnHave tried several other items as well. They all were okayokay, nothing great, can be rated as 3nPoori  Curry is too good, but pooris were not so thin. Better to have at the place than order.nMethi paratha  Again, curry is awesome, but paratha was not cooked evenly. Though, taste was good.nAloo paratha  Stuffing was not even. Few bites comprised of just dough.nThali  good, especially curries.nnAmbience  Its a small place  neat and simple. A house converted into an eatery., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Homely food with cozy outdoor seating, makes it a pretty good option to choose among. The staff is friendly and service is decent.

Pricing is ok comparatively. Didnt like the attitude of the outlet guys., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Spotted this hole in the wall shake outlet on this busy food street. Neat brand presentation and they were running an offer Rs.129 for a 200 shake. The girl in the counter was forthcoming in terms of explaining about the contents of the shake. Luckily their shakes are NOT just dilute milk and formula ready mix you get the reference right  . Ice cream  and syrupsauces were added in front of my eyes and a Thick shake was served in a bulb shaped bottle . Innovative alright but not convenient to hold . On top of that they had exhausted straws  nAt the discounted price a totality value thick milk shake of 500 ml . The hazelnut flavour was on the lighter side but nevertheless a good shake overall. Take away glass bottles are a huge , huge burden on environment  carbon footprint, added cost to customer, and additional thrash heaps in cities. Can milk shake shops stop this nonsense and use reusable glasses please, Rated 2.0, RATEDn  If you want fancy bottles, you can go there but when it comes to Whats inside this fancy bottles, its not the great Place. Just below average shakes, the cost is tooooo high. Not at all worth. I would like to pay more too only if the shake is great. But a Big No to this place., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Tried their hazelnut shake and some tripple chocolate shake. Both tasted amazing. Staffs were very friendly and extremely polite.

As three of us ordered for 5 butter naan thinking other places serve 2 pieces per naan but here it was 4 pieces. If the server have informed us about the quantity we would have ordered less.nAll in all a good place. Service was also quick.

We also ordered an Oreo Milkshake and whilst we were sipping on it, we found something stringy. Upon calling the waiter and asking him what that was, we were told that it was SHRIMP. Brownie points for being honest but SHRIMP IN A MILKSHAKE 15nnService the service again was just as ridiculous as finding shrimp in a milkshake. We were served the fish and 5 minutes later, were given the cutlery to eat it with. They didnt even have bottled water and the only choice we had was to drink it straight from their nasty glasses. 15nnAmbience the ambience is probably the ONLY good thing about the place. 25, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  A small cafe which took me by surprise when I ordered food there.

The Korean bbq chicken was average. More like stir fryed chicken with capsicum and a bit of gravy. The tandoori broccoli is a completely disaster. It is like a malai coating on broccoli.

Good place to visit., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Place is at the rooftop with a wide area of sitting. Somewhere they have placed even Swing seats . I liked the white theme sofas in the ambience. Food is average 35. Spinach corn pizza was pretty good in taste. Mocktails were not up to the mark it was looking like only syrup and water. Service was a bit slow 25.

Unfortunately I ordered Andhra meals. I am a big fan of Andhra meals, especially the soppu sar palak  dal. My goodness I cant even say even a single dish related to Andhra though. I really didnt understand the cuisine. nnReally, I feel bad giving such a rating because the setup was really nice, service was kind of okay, but the food was terrible. i mean is rasam tasted like sambar, sambar looked like rasam, I didnt understand one dish was karela fry till bearer explained .

It is moderately spicy.However, there is no compromise in taste.I was completely satisfied with the taste.We had items like Dal fry very good, mushroom curry good but a little bit sweet kinda taste, crispy chicken my friends say very good ,butter naan,curd rice, veg pulao little bit dull look P and but felt better with raitha.One more thing was, desserts were very limited.Apart from Spicy food lovers, everyone can give a try. , Rated 2.0, RATEDn  worst chilli chicken ever, Rated 3.0, RATEDn  I have tried food from this place twice. It is an average, daily affair restaurant  if thats what you are looking for.

Tasteless food, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Tried this new place Hasini foods for linch the other day. Tried the Mutton Biryani and a few non veg starters. Really liked the taste and aroma of the biryani prepared. And the chicken starter was real good. And an add on is its pretty affordable for the place like Koramangla. Would surely suggest people to give it a try coz i have myself oredered it again , Rated 1.0, RATEDn  A review about this restaurant so called Hasini Foods, Andhra Style... First thing when it comes to mind about Andhra Style is Spicy Food, but here... Apart from Pickle, nothing was spicy. Biriyani, worst in taste, ordered meals... Cant even think of it, being a typical south Indian, I could even enjoy the meals which they served , the serving boys, dont know anything very lazy didnt even keep water and also need to keep asking for food repeatedly, no papad was given.nnOverall worst food, better could have gone to a normal Andhra Mess... Who serves delicious food. Given the hotel team a advise, either remove Andhra Style in ur Name Board and Menu Card, or Change the chef... Till then my ratings are 1 for this restaurant.",[],Delivery,BTM,,

The food was neatly packed in foil boxes along with forks and napkins, and the order was delivered on time.nnComing to the food, the crispy pecking baby corn, in keeping with its name was indeed crispy, but was a little too spicy. A box of sauce was also provided with this. The cheese balls on the other hand was not exactly what I expected, but nevertheless, it was good.

Khatta Paneer was yumm...DalMakhni was decent, a really nice prep considering it was prepared without creambutter. Other dish was Veg Biryani, which again was surprisingly good. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Complimentary walnut cake was a bit mealy which was kinda offputting, but it didnt change my opinion of other items. Superfood of the day was also a nice addition.nnOverall, Im impressed. Will try nonveg options soon too. A job well done, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Ordered Chicken Curry with Brown Rice on a Sunday lazy afternoon. I am happy that it was just a great choice made by me...nnSuperb quality and Taste.

I was wrong on seeing the rating of 4.5 stars and ordered pizza. It tasted bad. It was just bread and tomato ketchup as sauce as margarita pizza, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  A really spacious outlet for one of the tastiest burgers in Koramangala. The ice creams are really good too. The management for dinein customers can improve a lot. All of that aside, the burger was really delicious and enough for one persons appetite. Even though it is a little bit on the expensive side, I love this place., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  This attractive icecream with a dollop of caramel with chocolate praline on top of coffee icecream is so pleasing to the eye for beating the summer heat. The wafer cup is super crunchy though the quantity is low for the premium price tag., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  I would say a decent place with a lot of space which can be better managed. But I loved the decor. Ice Creams were just too good btw. Has a decent price but on the higher side.

But this time decided to give their burgers a try. I must say Im impressed. Tried BBQ chicken burger and the chipotle lamb burger. Really liked the burgers with the patties real nice and juicy. I liked their virgin mojito as well. It was sour and sweet just the way I like it, but some people wouldnt prefer it to be sour., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Located on the Jyoti Niwas college road. This place has such vibrant and chirpy decor. Limited and ordinary menu. We ordered chocolate overload and blueberry cheese cake. Both were good in taste. Prices are justified for the quantity they serve. Can be tried if fond of having ice creams., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  This is a lively and fun place to be.nTheir cold coffee and pizza is good and must try when you go here.nIts open till 1 am and is a good hangout place., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Been here again and again and again and again. One of the best place for ice creams in Koramangla. Great location too. One can easily come for dessert after a heavy dine out from the nearby eateries. The ice creams are Bellissimo, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Food was finger licking. Do try the sauces they provide, right from Green chill, red chill, mayonnaise to normal ketchup. I mixed them all up and it tasted great. Paneer Tikka pizza was lit, potato burst burger was good and the chocolate caramel ice cream was just the icing on the cake. Recommended. However, would be great if the ice creams are brought after food not before, hence deducting that 1 star.nnAmbience45nFood55, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Undoubtedly your 1 AM best friend in KoramangalanWhether you are looking for some munchies after serious bar hopping or want a guilt tripping cheat day, Stoner is the place for you.

The burgers were all gooey and juicy goodness,with the fish burger easily grabbing the limelight.

Well, I wouldnt be kidding if I said that this burger was exactly that,and then some. The lamb burger was also good,so was the blueberry cheesecake ice cream served with a blueberry cheesecake on top. The mojito was good enough,no complaints there too.

This small outlet have few nice shakes on their menu. Lichi on the rocks is really a rocking one.nnIve also tried their Brownie Bites Belgian Waffle and that was one of the best waffle. I highly recommend that. At last I tried Red Velvet Ice Cream Sundae and this is not upto the mark or i must say according to my expectation after their waffle. It was extraaa sweet and they can serve it in better way., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  As a chocoholic i had a snickers extravaganza  a plain waffle wit vanilla ice  strawberry sauce. Both were wonderful  a hearty dessert to complete d day with after dinner. Many more on list to try which shall pull me again to come here.. Thickahakes  DBC yet to try.., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Had been to black deer for sweet tooth cravings. It is a tiny pretty cafe. Tried Belgian pot which had two scoops of chocolate icecream on Waffle. Very fresh and yummy. Waffle was still hot and my mouth waters whenever I think about it. Will come here again and again., Rated 2.0, RATEDn  So I ordered a hot chocolate fudge and a ice cream sundae. Instead of hot chocolate they sent an incorrect order and when I called, instead of understanding my issue, the customer care person just hung up the call in the middle of the conversation and now not picking up.nnI can understand the mix up in delivery. It happens. But customer service seems to be quite terrible., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Are you looking for some interesting ice cream something different from corner house and polar bear, then you are at the right placennThey have an interesting menu starting with Death By Orange, for a person who is not into chocolate can take a bite into this. Their Mango Masti and few other dishes look equally interesting. We also took a bite into their Oreo Belgian Waffle, in which cream is sandwiched between two chocolate waffles served with a topping off ice cream and oreos which is definitely delicious and extremely photogenic.nnThe store is pretty small, it is good to go for a bite with your bae with only two tables. The service is pretty quick and the people are really friendly., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Below average at best. Ordered death by chocolate sundae and they put frozen vanilla ice cream with few random nuts. And on top some COFFEE flavoured ice cream, yes, in a death by chocolate sundae. And yet there was no sign of chocolate in the whole sundae. No brownie, no fudge. Ice creams were tasteless and bland., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Not a bad place for desert cravings but the problem is aside for a few signature items everything else is just blah. So one can visit it once maybe twice but thats it. Whereas a desert place should be able to pull people in everytime they crave for desert. We tried the bubble shake dono order, mango shake, death by orange best order and oreo waffle best looking, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Black Deer is a cool restaurant to have some awesome Icecreams, the service is good too.

We ordered a full Alfaham, Crispy Potato starter, Plate Shawarma, Garlic Naan and Paneer Tikka Masala.

Today, hunger pangs made me order mix schezwan noodles because I was craving for fish.nnThe quantity is huge. In the picture, this is the quantity after I already ate a little. Delivery was super quick because otherwise Id have been dead. Delivery person was cordial. The fish in the noodles taste amazing. Also, chicken, fish and eggs have been added generously.

But Im sure it wasnt reserved for anyone because we were there for more than an hour but no one came.nComing to the food we ordered BBQ chicken, butter naan and pahadi chicken and they all tasted decent.nJust a small suggestion if people order for butter naan please do tell them about the quantity. As three of us ordered for 5 butter naan thinking other places serve 2 pieces per naan but here it was 4 pieces. If the server have informed us about the quantity we would have ordered less.nAll in all a good place. Service was also quick. Will surely visit the place again., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Visited for a nice dinner with friends, Fattoush delivered a little bit less than expected. Ambience was on point, music was not. We ordered Tiranga Paneer Tikka Can try, Veg Manchurian with fried rice Delicious, a must try, Dal Makhani ok ok, Masala Chholey Awesome, Naan better than roti, mocktail was not that good.","['Afghani

Place looks is not that great.. Little bit dark.. Food quality is good but over priced... Quantity is less according to the price...but.the worst part is. They added 10 service charage in our bill which is purely extra and it should not be added to the bill. 200 rs service charge we paid for 2000rs bill. Total 2200.. Otherwise food taste is good. Will give only 3 star for that. Advice to the restaurant management that dont add service charge in the bill. If customer wants to pay thats diff but u cant add that in bill., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Pros its Pecos. Good food. Good music. Good people.

And if you too love pizzas, this is a place you should try once. They do have pizzas displayed and i am pretty sure that you wont like the pizza seeing its thick base. But i must tell you, thats the trick there. I order a veg pizza with corn.... the base did look thick, but every bit of the base was perfectly baked which made the pizza supper soft and didnt give the taste of raw base. Plus they were not stingy with toppings and cheese. Also we ordered lemonade which they gave in small cute glass bottles. Kinda liked the look and taste as well. The cost is also reasonable for what they serve. For the service, it was very quick and they were well behaved. And the ambience was a bit better than any normal pizza restaurant. So, i would definitely recommend you to try here if you have not tried yet., Rated 4.5, RATEDn  It was my first time here. We ordered a meal for 2 combo. Yummmmmy tangy chicken pizza, something different in its Base, which I loved. The cheese garlic bread was good too. We were also served with Pepsi and 4 pieces of gonemad chocolates.

Plus their garlic bread is out of this world by this I mean you can avoid it. Plus if you have been duped to buy their vouchers for 599 then you should give away to someone who doesnt care about pizza quality and only likes to eat it.

We went around 4 in the afternoon. There were not many people. The ambience was quite good. Food was ok ok. We ordered yummy creamy pasta which was just ok. Not that great. It was more spicy than creamy. I can rate it 7 out of 10. We also ordered normal corny capsicano which had a very thick crust. Again the taste was just ok. 7 out of 10. You can visit this place when you are bored of pizza hut and dominos. Jus for a change, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Love dis place  not because they serve pizzas and I m a big pizza lover ,but because the lighter than air bread they serve. It is not at all heavy and pizza feels light with right amount of cheese and toppings. Try their garlic bread with cheese and mushrooms and whoopeezo pizza.nnfoodndestinations.com, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Tried the veg cheesy chilly pizza , veg arabiatta and chocolate mouse. The pizza was soft, the toppings fresh and the cheese melts in the mouth. I was not expecting a great pasta but surprisingly it was good. I had confirmed that it is in white sauce during the order however I was served with red sauce.When i raised a concern they duly changed it without any fuss. Decent service and ambience. Worth the money and they have options for mocktails too., Rated 3.5, RATEDn  Love this place........tried the veg and non veg pizzas... its yummy and flavorful...value for the money, they can improve the sides a little more mainly on the veg , non veg sides like the chicken wings is a killer perfecto... must visit for BTM ppl, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Yummy pizza Tried veg pizzas..Soft and fresh base with fresh vegetable toppings  Dont miss Tuesday and Thursday one on one free deal, Rated 1.0, RATEDn  No taste at all.

Just ordered a meal for 2 which included a Medium sized Pizza classic or Perfecto range, 4 portions of Garlic Bread, 2 Masala Lemonade  4 chocolate sticks. The Pizza really tasted good, cooked to perfection including the crust at the end. Garlic bread was quite tasty as well. Masala lemonade was just perfect. They ran out of stock for chocolate sticks so served us chocolate mousse, which again was yummy. I am quite impressed by their pizzas. They do have their own option of Cheese Burst and their own Chocolate Pizza and a range of Pastas, which I intend to try on my next visit. Definitely a good alternative if you are bored with Pizza Hut or Dominos. I am sure to visit this place quite often.

Both ways pizza was awesome and delightful., Rated 3.5, RATEDn  Food Pizza taste is quite decent. We ordered for a thin crust and it was perfect. These are hard base so dont expect itallian base.

Well I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone., Rated 3.5, RATEDn  Well, this place caught my attention because its right on the main udupi garden road. Being a pizza lover, i had no choice but to try it. The pizza is yummy definitely a thumbs up to that, and even the lemon soda was perfectly made. The ambience is also so apt and they even have props for your perfect selfies. The quotes written around will give you a nice pass time if you are waiting for your order. The only thing i love but i didnt like that much was caramel shot, the caramel was way too salty, though it was okay, but i wish the salt level in caramel was a lil low.

You can try it out if around that area., Rated 1.5, RATEDn  After reading reviews and seeing many pictures uploaded on zomato ,we visited this place with so much of expectation but it was very disappointing. Menu card also looked excited with many options of veg non veg pizza. We had ordered garlic bread with cheese mushroom , silli chilli pizza and Hawaiian chicken pizza.

Bragging about cheese in pizza does not help because the pizza was not at all chezzy. Overall quite inferior to other pizza chain restaurants. Not Recommended. Personally i will never visit again., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  We werent really hungry when we stepped into Whooppeezz for the first time ever, so we ordered the Minced Chicken pasta.

In fact, I almost confused it with a soupnIf you are guessing why I am still rating this place 3.0,its only because of the dessert items.nThe Chocolate cheesecake was absolutely lipsmacking. The caramel mousse was delightful enough for a guilty pleasure.nTip Visit this place for desserts ONLY, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Visited this place after much thought. Really didnt know if we want to be here. But we thought of trying something new and Im glad I tasted their pizzas.nThe pizzas are awesomely cooked to perfection, flavours are brilliant. We had the chicken paprika chilli medium pizza which was yum The crust was neither too think not too thick  just appropriate, with the right amount of cheese to make it soft and lovely to eat.nValue for money AwesomennIll definitely like to go back to try their everything else.nnGreat work, team, Rated 4.5, RATEDn  With just two outlets opened up in Bangalore and one being in BTM, I was super excited to pay a visit to them real soon. So here I was, for a Thursday dinner to try out Whooppeezz pizzas. It is a nicely done, peppy place with neatly arranged tables  I instantly liked the ambiance. For food, we ordered tangy chicken pizzas, BBQ chicken wings, chocolate bomb and fanta. Chicken wings were to die for, perfect BBQ sauce and wellcooked chicken with tangy taste. The pizza was quite a lot for two people with sufficient amount of cheese, garlic, onions and roasted chicken. nnOverall, I really liked them and the pizzas, price is reasonable, would definitely choose them above Pizza Huts., Rated 1.5, RATEDn  I badly wanted a change from the usual dominos or pizzahut but was disappointed. The pizza base wasnt baked well. I ordered a veg combo meal . I got a chocolate moose with it which had egg. A lot of egg. You could smell it from a distance. Not much variety in toppings. Nonetheless, ambience is good and bright. I would probably not go to whooppeezz again unless dominos or pizzahut is closed., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  GREAT AMBIANCE WOW SERVICE SUPER PIZZAAASS THE NEW PLACE WHICH IS OPENED IN BTM LAYOUT NEXT TO MARWA THATS WHOOPPEEZZ OSSSOM INTERIORS SUCH A WOWFUL PLACE TO VISIT AT BTM, Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Passing by the restaurant decided to give the place a try. Pretty general pick of pizzas with some refreshing options like the eggizza egg slices on top of pizza. Ordered eggizza and veg barbeque bonanza pizza. Eggizza was a little dry and bland. The veg pizza on the other hand had a good taste and barbeque flavor. The ambience was ok. They had a little corner with props where you can pose for a snap., Rated 2.0, RATEDn  A new addition in the neighborhood and we gave it a shot a couple of days back. A glam n bright ambiance does cheer you up, but the food does not unfortunately have the same effect. In fact, the couple of pizzas were quite bad. The pizza crust tasted a little like rusk with the cheese sitting loosely on it. Not worth the money spent. nnAlso, people taking orders definitely need more training., Rated 2.0, RATEDn  Yesterday night was my 1st experience with this place at btm. The table was messy with leftovers and bone remnants. Had to get the table cleaned but it still retained stickiness. The pizza was barely warm and we had to return the item for reheating. Pasta was bad and less said about the chocolate bomb. It was a dud and left a chewy taste in our mouth.nNot exactly a great experience with this place as the pizza was just below average. Sad , Rated 3.5, RATEDn  Whooppeezz is the newest outlet in BTM Area. This is the 2nd outlet under the Whooppeezz brand. The ambiance is lively with emphasis on white, red and yellow. The seating is also interesting and so is the wall with pizza quotes.nnOrdered the Meal for 1 so that we would try their cheesy Garlic bread and a small size pizza. The combo also comes with a Pepsi and a chocolate bar. The combo is value for money. The order took less than 10mins. First came the Garlic bread, the bread were crisp from outside and soft from inside. Delicious.nnOrdered the Hawaiian Pizza with Jalapeno and Pineapple on top.

They dont give you plates or forks etc. The pizza and sides were served in cardboard boxes. If you are sharing it with someone it could be messy and tricky.nn2. Parking its on the busy road right in front of raheja arcade and near forum mall. So always difficult to find a parking place especially for 4 wheelers.nnFinal Verdict Would choose this place over Pizza Hut Its not gourmet wood fired pizza, but definitely better than Pizza Hut, Rated 2.0, RATEDn  The place reminded me of the old US Pizza joints. the crust felt like it was a premade dry bread, topped with cheese and other toppings. The pizza crumbled on hand, as we picked it up., Rated 3.5, RATEDn  This opened up nearby and my brother n I had to try their pizza. Trust me, it was a breathe of fresh air to try pizzas other than Pizza Hut and Dominos.nnBut, the pasta was not at all upto the expectation.",[],Dine-out,BTM,,

Been here several times for breakfast and authentic south Indian Thali. My office is nearby from there. I have liked their maintained of hygiene and sanitation first of all. In a busy traffic mode also the cleaning is on schedule every time without fail. Apart from that they have a vast menu to choose out. If you are planning to go for a lunch that to on a working day please opt for self service. Sometimes in that also you canx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92t find a place to stand.

If one were looking for a nice dining experience, well, they wouldnt really be considering this place anyway., Rated 1.0, RATEDn  This place has lost its value because the food they serve now are not good. We ordered rava idly and it was not even hot. It was completely dried as if it was prepared 56 hours before. They didnt have the courtesy to at least heat the idly. We were given sabzi which is given for poori instead of sambhar.nnI think its time for the hotel management to take it seriously and serve tasty food like it was 2 years ago., Rated 3.5, RATEDn  Youd almost not notice this Karnataka styled South Indian restaurant amidst all the McD, Pan America and Chinese restaurants near by. But they stand out for their Masala Dosas and Filter Coffees. Must say they are descent with their North Indian dishes too. Economical and first class quality ., Rated 3.5, RATEDn  You might never notice this small south indian joint among the big names like CPK, Empire etc. They are like any other SukhShanti Sagars in the city.nThey have a regular tiffin section and also a seating section. It is a small place with some cosy sofas. Menu ranges from meals to idlis to dosas and also rotinaan with any north indian sabzi. Perfectly vegetarian.nThe Gobi Manchurian is nice and tangy. Even roti curry is standard and good.nWhat I liked was sambar dipped idli. Tasted good sambar after a long time. The waiter was courteous and helped me with dry chutney which they normally serve only for parcels.

The place was empty so seemed like the perfect place for the some good time.nnStarted off by showing ZomatoGold which the waiter says isnt applicable on Mocktails. On showing him the rules and regulations and having a quick chat with the manager he agreed to serve Mocktails. By then our mood was already out but we decided to go ahead with the drinks.

Its nothing like the JP nagar 55 Wall St. The zomato gold cocktail portions were very small. If the restaurant wants to entice people with zomato gold and serve half the quantity why offer it in the first place To cheat people The only reason why Im giving them 2 stars instead of 1 is because the Live band singer was great, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  I can give a 65 only for the DJ.

If you really want to try all veg cuisines under one roof, this is the place and all of them taste so good..The staff is also very friendly and courteous.

Very near to my house around 800mtr walking, however theres another outlet around kamannahalli as well. The place in Frazer Town seemed like an old house which has been turned into a restaurant with decent decor and gives a homely feeling as well. We ordered for a grilled pepper chicken steak and a bbq beef tenderloin, both of them were well done and tasted great. The price is pretty affordable as well, a meal for 2 without Zomato gold will cost you around 1200 odd bucks, however since I had a gold membership it costed me around 700 bucks.nnIdeal place for a good dinner with your family which is pocket friendly as well. Also, if you want to go with your friends for a drink, not a bad place to visit as well. Lastly, the place also serves breakfast, planning to head for it sometime soonnnHappy Munchin , Rated 3.0, RATEDn  The menu is extensive and this place has a cozy feel to it. The checkered table cloths and the long benches bring out the oldschool feel. The steaks are a bit dry for my liking, but the veggies are fresh and the portions are really filling. The jack daniels and chicken chimichurri have a nice spiced up yet subtle flavour. Its not too hot but still leaves a spicy note at the end. Pick me up is a refreshing drink to accompany these heavy stakes., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Love the fact that 2 ppl can eat their SO CALLED 1 burger happily  We has the soul beef and something else which was to have beef n bacon, however, they missed out on the bacon n added ham slices. Not sure about the mixup but we ended up polishing that either way.nAlso, the complimentary garlic bread is yummm. I enjoy that every time. The wings were fantastic and I recommend this coz Plan B was the only other place I remember having good wings. The cheese on the Pizza was LOADED and it wasnt too great, however, all in all, a good time U0001f91f, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Favourite Steak HousennConnies steaks are unique and different from any other steakhouse in town. The ambiance was very normal and nothing fancy.nnI ordered one Tbone steak tenderloin. This will beat any steak in their menu. New York steak was the other steak we ordered. This was not that different from what we get from other restaurants.nnFor desserts we ordered Carmel custard. This was a fail and probably wouldnt recommend to order from their dessert menu.nnThe service was fast and good. The prices are very high and not pocket friendly at all. The quality of food is good., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  This is now my new favorite place for wings, and by a long way. Delicious, delicious wings. Just a little crispy on the outside. Soft and succulent within. Should have gone for the largennWell cooked steak. A burger bursting with flavor.nnFriendly staff and good ambiance. A must visit in Coxtown., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  A big fan of the steaks at Connies Restaurant and Steakhouse.nnVisited their Frazer Town branch for the first time with a friend and ordered the Connies Classics  Jack Daniels Beef Steak and the Pepper Roast Tenderloin Steak Keto. My friend follows the Keto diet so its great that theres that added option. Both the steaks were thankfully and predictably on point.nnThe complimentary Garlic breads that were served before the steaks arrived, were as always wonderfully tasty.nnP.S  Enjoy 11 on food with Zomato Gold., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  , Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Pleasing decor, good location, courteous service  decent food.nI had my favourite Tenderloin Steak here. They served 2 pieces of garlic bread before the order arrived like decent Continental restaurants do. The roasted pepper steak which I had ordered didnt take long to arrive. It turned out to be rather nice. The sauce had mixed well with the meat which was nicely medium to well done, the way I usually ask for, having said that the taste reminded me slightly of a street food called Phal. This can surely be taken care of by the people in the kitchen.nThe decor  the space inside is particularly worth mentioning. It is like a decently painted  maintained house with pleasantly decorated tables  framed pictures on the walls. There are separate rooms to sit which may provide privacy if one seeks so.nThe service is courteous  prompt., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  This place never disappoints. Great ambience, quick service and amazing food. The steaks are the must trys here. Vegetarians also have decent choices in all category to choose. Both their outlets are good in terms of food and service but this one offers better ambience., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Good place. Great for steak s . Dont recommend pizzas . Not crowded and appears to be new. Service round the clock sounds exciting. Havent tried in the nights though. Do visit, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  I am going to keep it short. The ambience is good, the food is really good and the service is super good. This place has this warm welcoming vibe and you wouldnt mind going there again if it comes to that. We ordered a burger chicken 45, sizzler veg 35 and they gave garlic bread 55. We were feeling so good after eating here that we refused to use our zomato gold offer because at a place where you genuinely enjoyed the experience you shouldnt really be thinking about some membership benefit., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Theyre tag line is quite literal.

The portioning sizes have reduced from the last time of we visited but the taste and quality is still amazing. The only let down was the jack Daniel beef burger. I have had their double decker burgers before, its moist and juicy but this one in particular was dry and lacked a little bit of taste or the connies touch. Over all it was a good meal., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Quaint setting makes this place almost invisible. But do go visit it. They have amazing steaks and English breakfast. The minimalistic old school decor makes it prettier, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Looking for something different we hit Connies one afternoon. The laid back ambiance, the music and the scintillating food all contribute to the popularity of Connies. We tried out the steaks and sizzlers along with a host of other stuff. Must admit it was mouthwatering. The complementary garlic bread was an instant hit with the kids. However did not enjoy the mousse, the only dish we left. My son likes the pasta and everytime we visit Bangalore, it is one of his first requests among many. nNot satisfied with one visit we also ordered food on the phone the next day. The owner takes personal care of the guests which is very heartening. This place is good for parties and small gatherings., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  A pretty cool place for a nice meal. Go get your steak and burger cravings filled here. But be careful of their burgers  they are huuuge Oh And dont forget their caramel custard for dessert. Pretty special.",[],Delivery,Church Street,,

This outlet wins hands down as the go to place each time I had the yen for badam halwa. Loved their newer small 100 gm packing which means I can binge sitting anywhere in the world, thanks to friends in blr who know the depth of this addiction The savories are tolerable, but the badam halwa, either cold or nuked to release the humungous amounts of ghee and fragrance is truly divine, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  SKS is a mithai shop of Tamil Nadu origin, specifically famous for their Mysore Pak, which is heavily loaded with ghee. Once mysore pak comes in contact with your salaiva, chemical reaction starts, and the dish starts melting in your mouth .

Having tried a few different baos from various spots across the city I decided to give this place a shot after reading some encouraging reviews. I ordered a Sri Lankan chicken bao and a Kung Pao prawns bao.  In both cases, the marinade and spices were absolutely fantastic both flavours were very authentic and the steamed bao was of great quality. The only grouse I had, was them skimping out on the meat quantity. The chicken was barely acceptable quantities whereas the prawn bao was more of a capsicum bao with just a few little shrimps thrown in. If they improve the quantity of meat in the wraps i think this is a winning combination of taste variety and value for money. Pros  excellent taste in both items value for money  good quality ingredients Cons  skimpy meat quantity, Rated 4.5, RATEDn  Amazing food, we had spinach cheese crepe and waffle with ratatouille. Peaceful place and spacious. Ambiente is simple, but has christmas feel in December., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  It was awesome to taste the yummy Baos ... the bread so soft and tasty ...

A must visit in Coxtown., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  A big fan of the steaks at Connies Restaurant and Steakhouse.nnVisited their Frazer Town branch for the first time with a friend and ordered the Connies Classics  Jack Daniels Beef Steak and the Pepper Roast Tenderloin Steak Keto. My friend follows the Keto diet so its great that theres that added option. Both the steaks were thankfully and predictably on point.nnThe complimentary Garlic breads that were served before the steaks arrived, were as always wonderfully tasty.nnP.S  Enjoy 11 on food with Zomato Gold., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  , Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Pleasing decor, good location, courteous service  decent food.nI had my favourite Tenderloin Steak here. They served 2 pieces of garlic bread before the order arrived like decent Continental restaurants do. The roasted pepper steak which I had ordered didnt take long to arrive. It turned out to be rather nice. The sauce had mixed well with the meat which was nicely medium to well done, the way I usually ask for, having said that the taste reminded me slightly of a street food called Phal. This can surely be taken care of by the people in the kitchen.nThe decor  the space inside is particularly worth mentioning. It is like a decently painted  maintained house with pleasantly decorated tables  framed pictures on the walls. There are separate rooms to sit which may provide privacy if one seeks so.nThe service is courteous  prompt., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  This place never disappoints. Great ambience, quick service and amazing food. The steaks are the must trys here. Vegetarians also have decent choices in all category to choose. Both their outlets are good in terms of food and service but this one offers better ambience., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Good place. Great for steak s . Dont recommend pizzas . Not crowded and appears to be new. Service round the clock sounds exciting. Havent tried in the nights though. Do visit, Rated 5.0, RATEDn  I am going to keep it short. The ambience is good, the food is really good and the service is super good. This place has this warm welcoming vibe and you wouldnx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92t mind going there again if it comes to that. We ordered a burger chicken 45, sizzler veg 35 and they gave garlic bread 55. We were feeling so good after eating here that we refused to use our zomato gold offer because at a place where you genuinely enjoyed the experience you shouldnx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92t really be thinking about some membership benefit., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Theyre tag line is quite literal.

Its a new cafe in the neighborhood which is literally a stones throw for me.nnWe thought of having chai and indulging in Chaats one evening, and decided to give this place a try. While the food was good, the service was seriously slacking.nnThe cafe is huge and was practically empty. Despite this, they took half an hour to serve the food. The fact is that it doesnt take too long to make Chaats as all the ingredients are ready. And with this place being empty the delay didnt make any sense.nnThe servers were roaming aimlessly, and there was no cutlery on the table either. They really need to pay attention to detail and buck up on their service., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Absolutely loved the cafe. They have two seating options, opengarden side on the ground and a fine dine restaurant types on the 1st floor. We chose to sit in the open, since there was a kid with us ample space to move and run around. Between 4 adults and 1 child, we ordered one starter, 3 mains and coffee. Our total bill was 1200, inclusive of taxes and service charge, thus making this an incredibly affordable place for the good variety and quality. We ordered semolina crusted cakes for starters, which is basically a fusion version of paneer tikka. Main course was green Thai curry and rice, nutty noodles a chef speciality, and absolute delicious, and an arrabiata pasta. The only disappointment was, they didnt have most of the desserts listed in their menu being served the day we visited. Worth visiting this place, for their diverse and innovative menu., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  I loved the ambience of the place, its lovely.nThe staff has to be a little more informed about things.

Overall, a great place to catch up with friends for party, Rated 2.0, RATEDn  Liked the basic menu n the food, pathetic service staff who are only good at speaking n not getting the things u ordered on time, the basic fries, omelette n noodles take ages n had to beg for water n after repeatedly asking them they again say 2 minutes. Needless to say please up your service game., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Go there for the ambiance and food wont disappoint you either.nnAmbiance Terrace bar at center with tables around. Overlooking whatever greenery left on MG Road. Then comes a deck on the left hand side with few seats. couple of tables are right on the edge of MG Road. It can be chilly in the evening. We chose to sit on the deck.nnFoodnnChilly Pork our good old bar food. it was done well.nnFish fingers It was crispy and tasty.nnChicken pizza I wasnt sure about ordering naan pizza but it was not a bad choice afterall. lot of toppings and bread was crispy yet not hard.nnOver all a great place to hang out. Music is not too loud, easy on ears., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Situated on the terrace of a building in MG road, the ambience is fantabulous. This place has quite a vast seating area with an attractive bar counter being in the center. We received a warm and a cozy welcome from the staff and being friendly and courteous left no chance for us to complain. For lunch we tried their butter chicken which was nothing great but just okay. I would say this place is perfect to relax with a drink in hand., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  The food here is decent.

The place majorly has outdoor seating. In indoors they have Bohemian style interior decor. So we chose to sit outside in fresh air to enjoy our Blueberry Cheesecake and Peach Iced Tea. Oh the cheesecake has a very smooth and creamy with an apt amount of sweetness in it. the cake just melts in your mouth. Its that good. The iced tea is also worth a shot because very few places in Bangalore serve a good iced tea.

Also food didnt taste good either. We ordered chicken steak and veg hakka noodles where chicken was really dry and they gave pasta instead of noodles.nLittle disappointed in food section apart from which everything was good., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Had been to this place with some friends. Located very close to MG Road Metro Station, a rooftop place with great ambience  amazing music. They also have a large screen to telecast matches. We ordered multiple drinks Beer, LIT, Gin  Whiskey with some starters viz. Masala Peanut, Cheese Nachos, Jalapex83x83x82x83x83x82x82o Cheese Balls, Paneer Tikka  Lemon Chicken. All that we ordered tasted great. The staff were friendly  quick to respond. Overall, a great place to catch up with friends for party, Rated 2.0, RATEDn  Liked the basic menu n the food, pathetic service staff who are only good at speaking n not getting the things u ordered on time, the basic fries, omelette n noodles take ages n had to beg for water n after repeatedly asking them they again say 2 minutes. Needless to say please up your service game., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Go there for the ambiance and food wont disappoint you either.nnAmbiance Terrace bar at center with tables around. Overlooking whatever greenery left on MG Road. Then comes a deck on the left hand side with few seats. couple of tables are right on the edge of MG Road. It can be chilly in the evening. We chose to sit on the deck.nnFoodnnChilly Pork our good old bar food. it was done well.nnFish fingers It was crispy and tasty.nnChicken pizza I wasnt sure about ordering naan pizza but it was not a bad choice afterall. lot of toppings and bread was crispy yet not hard.nnOver all a great place to hang out. Music is not too loud, easy on ears., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Situated on the terrace of a building in MG road, the ambience is fantabulous. This place has quite a vast seating area with an attractive bar counter being in the center. We received a warm and a cozy welcome from the staff and being friendly and courteous left no chance for us to complain. For lunch we tried their butter chicken which was nothing great but just okay. I would say this place is perfect to relax with a drink in hand., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  The food here is decent.

Slightly disappointed with the lack of cleaning, the place has food everywhere and you had to step on it. Please check on that.nThe food is decently priced and okay. But the quantity can be slightly increased. 5 grilled prawns for 600 is way too much The club sandwich which we ordered was also overpriced and had the chicken and egg only on the one side. The bread was flaky and was falling apart. Why you do this people You get better sandwiches from roadside places nNot saying its bad, for that money in church street I can get much much better food.nService 35nFood 35nAmbience 45nValue for money 25, Rated 2.0, RATEDn  Ambiance  The place is located above Ameoba on Church Street. Really huge space and simple elegant decor. Restrooms are clean and hygienic. nThe reason we choose this place was primarily because we could sit and chat for hours without interference from the staff or other visitors.nnService  The staff were sweet and courteous. The waiter explained each of the dish and how they would be presented before he confirmed our order, which was a first.nnPrice  Surely on the expensive side.nnTaste  I tried the following items.nnVeg chimichanga  It was basically a full course meal with tomato chutney, cucumber, flavoured rice, a deep fried cheese roll and yoghurt. Served in large quantity. The rolls cheese filling fills you up very soon.nTaste wasnt greatnnMasala French fries  Was served with a dip and was very spicy.nnnCold coffee  This turned out to be the best try.

Thats one reason I prefer this place. Plus happy hours on beer, cocktails from 12 to 8pm, 11. They have weekday buffet for 399 plus taxes. Decent one. They do have a alcart n have some steaks n sizzlers on the menu. I personally didnt like it as the meet was pretty hard, rest was all fine. Not light on the pocket, btw affordable too., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  If youre in the mood for a wholesome old fashioned Bangalore beef burger, head to 20 feet high on Church Street. Granted, it may seem faraway since most of us no longer live within the central business district, but hey Its totally worth it., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  On a weekend afternoon after our work at MG Road, we thought of going to iconic 13th Floor for lunch. But it was closed or may be opens only in evening. So as an alternative we thought of going somewhere else. Finally ended up at this restaurant.nAmbiance Nice, woody smell and comfortable chairs. No A.C. as it is open from sides but roof is covered.nFood We opted for Lunch Buffet. Tomato cream soup was really good. Garlic bread was stale. Chicken wings werent good. Chicken salad and potato chaat was good though. Veg Manchurian was good. Also there was a live counter for pasta and we tried veg penne pasta in white sauce and penne arabitta pasta. Both were not good. Rest of the items in main course were just Ok. In deserts they had chocolate brownie, black jamun, black forest pastry. I tried black jamun and it was hopeless to say the least. Black forest was just about ok. Ice cream was also served and it was ok.nService Average., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Have passed by this place so many times final got to visit yesterday for lunch. The food was good. Mutton sizzlers were great and they were good enough to break the bone to get at the marrow. Chicken sizzler was equally good. The portions were quite substantial. The only defect was the service was shoddy on a day when it was not even quarter full., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Located on Church Street, a hungry stomach and a craving for steak made us decide to visit this place. Nice touch on those tricolor cakes to celebrate independence day by the way. The ambience is good by being open air, however, I think it would be better if they keep smoking and non smoking zones separate. Ordered two steaks, 20 feet special and chateaubrand, and both were satisfying more or less. Would rate 3.55., Rated 3.0, RATEDn  A decent enough place with decent food and service. nTried their Veg Caesar Salad, veg platter and Pasta. All of them were OK, nothing commendable.nZomato Gold was denied for nonalcoholic drinks and when my friend asked for a specific type of drink with Gold privileges, he was denied saying only a couple of drinks were available with Gold. And all that was only for that hour of time, they say. Doesnt make any sense, right nSo we settled the bill for what we had ordered and that was it. , Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Best place to drink  The ambience was not that good as we expected anyway we loved the food and it was well served Pastas were really good , Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Located on Church Street, a hungry stomach and a craving for steak made us decide to visit this place.

We have not ordered any food as we were chilling and drinking.nOverall experiencenService 55nEntertainment 55nAmbience 55, Rated 4.0, RATEDn  A great place. Good ambiance with multiple sitting options. The food n the drinks menu is quite good. The taste of food was also nice. I wud definitely go again.nBut the show stopper was the wonderful n very very musically delightful experience of listening to a live performance of violin.

After minor hiccup of getting desired seats, they were quick to take and deliver the order. Music was good and food was tasty. Drinks were good and the overall experience was liked by everyone in team., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  This is a hidden gem of a restaurant. A rooftop bar and restaurant opposite the MG Road metro station. Make sure to be seated on the upper tier. Over looking the metro and garden opposite, restaurant provides an excellent ambience to enjoy food and drinks with friends. The food is tasty but portions are small. The naan pizza are amazing. Definitely worth a try. The drinks are good. But could be better. If they can add craft beers to their menu, it would be great. The service is quick and efficient., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  It was not a planned visit. I and my friends decided to visit a place which will give you serene environment.

They bring you a full plate of everything and even after insisting to bring us just samples, they wonx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92t budge. It is a good thing if you have a large appetite or going with a lot of friends, but we were just two and ended up wasting some food.

They donx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92t do home delivery. On the app the Zomato delivery doesnx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92t work either. So having set our hearts on a Saturday evening winding down with some Onesta pizza, we decided to do a takeaway.nUnfortunately, there was a traffic jam and we reached 15min later than scheduled. And unfortunately, the lukewarm pizzas didnx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92t taste good at all. Wasabi, Alfredo, Cream Roasted Chicken and the Sweet Corn Pineapple were all uniformly disappointing. Next time we have to do the dinein to make sure the standards here are as good as the Koramangala outlet., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Onesta is a decent restaurant which serves delicious Pizzas  Starters. They have different packages based on our requirement. I opted for unlimited menu, so I ended up tasting almost all the items  Fish fingers, crispy chicken, Prawn pizza  potato wedges are really good. Overall I like it, good food  decent ambience.nnAtikur did a best service at Onesta , Rated 2.0, RATEDn  To be honest i try very hard to appreciate a cuisine restaurant. But the pizzas in onesta was at best bland.nTruly sorry but I will not recommend onesta honestly.nWe orderedn1. Fish fingersn2. Margherita pizzan3. Roast chicken pizzan4.Potato wedgesn5. Chicken Pasta  GoodnWe had visited Ministry of pizza in Koramangala which was great flavour in the mouth.nFlavour was unfortunately absent.nThe other thing is add pizza size options. There are only 4 inch pizzas., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Best thing to open in this area, extremely helpful and sweet staff here and yummy food as usual. Well keep coming back. Shankar was very helpful ., Rated 4.5, RATEDn  A lovely surprise in electronic City. They have aservice and pricing format that is great. Small portions and related pricing. And the food tastes good. We had ordered only veg pitzzas for a change. And they were exceptional Small size means you can try more variety. Tthe staff were friendly and efficient.nThe desserts were only ok.

There was a tiny chicken piece which we could be seen only through magnifying equipments like viewing lense or something like that. Then coming to the chicken kebab.. some fried powder that left over when we fry something. I will never recommend Dine garden family restaurant. Once again I am confirming all the readers that this is my personal opinion about the biriyani combo at Rs.99 which I ordered through zomato on 8.12.2018 around 12.30pm. I would rate this food is very poor. Thank you., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Ordered dum biriyani and kebab...was little spicy ....but tasty.. ....

One can come here, grab a kettle of Jasmine tea and a book for hours at a stretch.nThey have quite a small menu, but the same cannot be said about the flavour and the portions which were just right about right for 2.nThe staff were very courteous.nDo try their Mushroom soup, Greek salad, garlic bread, Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, Jasmine tea and 6 layer chocolate cake., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  The best red velvet pastries which I never had in my life.lot variety of desserts with best service and good ambience.this Italian style kitchen serves best desserts and food","['Nutella Ferrero Rocher', 'Dark chocolate Fudge', 'Newyork Cheese Cake', 'Oreo Cheese Cake', 'Six Layer Cake', 'Falafel', 'Ratatouille Rice Dish', 'Zucchini Rolls', 'Pita Pocket Pizza', 'Minestrone Soup', 'Sweet Corn Soup', 'Mushroom Soup', 'Vegan Creamy Pumpkin Soup', 'Capers Salad', 'Caesar Salad', 'Grilled Vegetable Salad', 'Greek Salad', 'Tabasco Pizza', 'Veggie Supreme Pizza', 'Tomato and Mozzarella Pizza', 'Capricciosa Pizza', 'Tutti Funghi Pizza', 'Vegan Pizza', 'Ragi Pizza', 'Arrabbiata Pasta', 'Alfredo Pasta', 'Pesto Pasta', 'Ravioli', 'Spaghetti Aglio E Olio', 'Mac n Cheese', 'Vegetable Lasagna', 'Sundried Panini', 'Hummus Sandwich', 'Club Sandwich', 'Greek Wrap with Avocado', 'Dolci Burger', 'Egg Club Sandwich', 'Croissants Plain', 'Croissants Cheese', 'Whole Wheat Bread', 'White Bread', 'Brown Bread', 'Dinner Roll', 'Panini', 'Burger Bun', 'Multigrain Bread', 'Pesto Rolls', 'Cinimon Roll', 'Salted Fries', 'Tadka Fries', 'Peanut Butter Roast', 'Nachos with Cheese', 'Peanut Butter Toast', 'Garlic Bread', 'Garlic Bread with Cheese', 'Cheese Bolls With Salsa', 'Chilli Cheese Toast', 'Gluten Free Lasagna', 'Millet Crackers', 'Ragi Cookies', 'Profiterols', 'Meringue', 'Florentine', 'Fresh Cream Truffles', 'Sticky Choco Walnut', 'Doughnut', 'Chocolate Praline Tart', 'Triple Chocolate Moouse', 'Cake Pops', 'Nutella Ferrero Rocher', 'Macroon', 'Ragi Cookies', 'Tiramisu', 'Dark chocolate Fudge', 'Brownie', 'Newyork Cheese Cake', 'Baked Cheese Cake', 'Nutella Fudge Cake', 'Red Velvet Cake', 'Oreo Cheese Cake', 'Red Velvet Cup Cake', 'Six Layer Cake', 'Nutella Cheese Cake', 'Caramel Walnut Cake', 'Mud Cake', 'Biscuit Cake', 'Chocolate Cake', 'Nutella Ice Cream Cake', 'Cappucino', 'Espresso', 'Americano', 'Latte', 'Mocha', 'Hot Chocolate', 'Tea', 'Milkshake', 'Oreo Shake', 'Dolci Frappe', 'Dolci Choco Frappe', 'Dolci Fudge Frappe', 'Iced Tea', 'Nutella Shake', 'Cool Cucumber Juice', 'The Cure Juice', 'Rejuvenate Me Juice', 'De Stress Teas Juice']",Cafes,Frazer Town,,

Today my dessert came in a broken box Not just that, my food was all messy inside the box. Almost made me feel that the delivery guy has opened and eaten Either way, going to reduce the frequency of ordering from eat.fit now. Theyre a famous brand now so perhaps they donx83x83x82x82x83x82x82x92t feel the need to satisfy the customers with quality food and packaging anymore something they built a brand on., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  The food here really does taste like its homemade, with not a lot of oil. The Veg Thaali is very tasty, with a Paneer gravy and a Dal Makhani. Non veg is good too.nnThe Keema chicken paratha roll isnt very great, it was quite dry and the chutney was the only thing which was making it palatable.nnOne suggestion I have is to provide smaller servings of the dishes, for example just 2 rotisparathas with a side dish instead of 3. The number of options for lighter meals, around 300 calories, can be increased., Rated 4.0, RATEDn  Last week when I visited my friend in Indiranagar, we ordered some fruit oats from Eat.Fit.nTrust me, its damn good Totally worth of having.nWe loved it , Rated 4.0, RATEDn  This is the perfect place for a quick healthy bite. I wasnt too impressed with the meals as everything they serve is prepared beforehand, including the chapatis, so it wasnt fresh at all. But the coffee and the brownie was what had my heart. It was amazing. The sandwiches and nuts are also good., Rated 5.0, RATEDn  Couple of time ordered food online and it was really good.Been to indiranagar outlet and really liked the ambience.If you are health conscious that this would be the best choice to go for, Rated 3.0, RATEDn  Packaging is great. Ordered chef special non veg thali. Dal makhani wasnt tasty and chicken was okish as well. I tried the same thali from eat fit varthur which was a bit better than this outlet.
